This comes a little late. Before this week is over, make one observation about the viability of Asimov's Three Laws of Robotics either in 'The Evitable Conflict' (short story) or 'Three Robots' (from Love, Death +Robots) by engaging with one science fiction 'icon' and what it represents -- robots, mad scientist, damsel in distress, computers, the city, habitats, etc. Is the use of the icon typical? If not, what changed from the usual understanding of that icon?
